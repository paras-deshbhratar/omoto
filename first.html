            This is a sample survey design for us to visualise how the welcome page on the survey would look like. The
            welcome text could be as big as a paragraph like this or it could be just a couple of lines. The design
            must be
            minimalist and would focus on the use of great typeface to create beautiful design. Of course, the colour
            and
            theme is configurable.
